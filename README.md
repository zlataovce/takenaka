## Features

* fetching and deserialization of various mappings
* parsing of the server JAR (modifiers, superclasses, superinterfaces and more)
* cross-version mapping history comparison
* web documentation generation (including generics!)

### Planned features

- [ ] reflective accessor generation

### Mappings

- [x] Mojang mappings
- [x] Intermediary (FabricMC) mappings
- [x] Searge (Forge) mappings
- [x] Spigot mappings
- [x] Yarn (FabricMC) mappings
